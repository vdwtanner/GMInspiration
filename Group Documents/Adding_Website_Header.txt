header.php has been added to the repo. With this, you can now add the basic site header to any .php page
(This means all pages with probs have to go php. Down with .html!!! All hail the .php!!!)

Just add the line

	<?php include "header.php";?>

after your .css links, then place a

	<div id="container">

around your page's content in the body.

Please refer to profile.php and profilesettings.php for examples.
